# **VE414 Final Project**

## **Start our Bayesian Analysis project** 
The whole project is focus on predict how many trees and the corresponding
distribution in Jiuling as described in the [project_414.pdf](https://github.com/JackSnowWolf/VE414_final_project/blob/master/project_414.pdf). 
Our solution is described in the [ve414_project.pdf](https://github.com/JackSnowWolf/VE414_final_project/blob/master/ve414_project.pdf).

We are required to use julia to implement our algorithm without advanced julia packages.
The main function is written in [project.jl](https://github.com/JackSnowWolf/VE414_final_project/blob/master/project.jl)
and other related source files are in [src](https://github.com/JackSnowWolf/VE414_final_project/tree/master/src) folder.

## Plots
 All plots are stored in [pic](https://github.com/JackSnowWolf/VE414_final_project/tree/master/pic) folder.
* Scatter plot for observation points with and without Tayes.

* Tayes with estimated tree's location

## Future Work

Actually, our model is not good. We still need a lot of work to do.
Please see the __Future Work__ part in our ppt [ve414_project.pdf](https://github.com/JackSnowWolf/VE414_final_project/blob/master/ve414_project.pdf).
